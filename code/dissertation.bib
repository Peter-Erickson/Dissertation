First, the article examines regional and partisan representation in the U.S. military and suggests that existing imbalances are likely to grow worse over time. The article then argues that the most obvious policy response, a renewed draft, would in fact fail to adequately bridge the gap. Finally, the article outlines one policy response—the reassertion of nonpartisan norms—that would help to mitigate, though not close, the gap.},

	annotation = {The decision by House and Senate Democrats -- and, to a lesser extent, some presidential candidates -- reflects a belief that most of the nation remains firmly behind the war, along with the traditional inclination by political leaders not to second-guess a president's foreign policy while the nation is engaged in battle.
But Democrats say they are responding, as well, to the politically damaging storm that broke around Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, after he said on the eve of the war that Mr. Bush's diplomatic efforts had been a failure. Since then, Mr. Daschle has been thrashed by Republican and conservative leaders in Washington and, not incidentally, back home in South Dakota, where he faces re-election next year.
What is more, several Democrats said they were reluctant to criticize the war two weeks into it, particularly amid what some see as signs that it might not be going well for the administration, a perception underlined by the daily television narration of the war by mostly retired generals.
''Democrats don't need to do any criticism of the Bush administration right now,'' said Jenny Backus, a Democratic Party consultant with close ties to Congress. ''The unnamed generals are doing that job for us.''
So it is that most Congressional Democrats, including members who voted against the resolution last year that gave Mr. Bush authority to move against Iraq and opposed the policy until the bombing in Baghdad began, have muffled any reservations they have.
''We had a very vigorous debate,'' said Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who was an opponent of the Iraq resolution. ''Now the president is executing the war.''
Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, acknowledged that Democrats were being extremely cautious in their remarks, but said that there was good reason for it.
''I think in time of war the first instinct is to be supportive of the troops in the field,'' Mr. Reed said. ''You think, How is it going to play with the soldiers doing their job. I think that is our overriding concern.''
Speaking of what some see as Republican intimidation, another Democratic senator said: ''There is a view that these guys play hardball. They do not brook dissent.''
There is no better example of that than Mr. Daschle, who went almost overnight from being a leading Senate critic of Mr. Bush's war policy to being, by all appearances, a strong supporter.
Since March 17, when Mr. Daschle said Mr. Bush's diplomatic failures had helped cause the war, he has been nothing but complimentary. Today, he again sidestepped a question about whether the administration had misjudged resistance, saying there would be time later for such an examination.
''I think our troops are doing an absolutely superb job,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''We get briefed daily, and I am struck by the extraordinary professionalism that is demonstrated each and every day.''
Allies of Mr. Daschle and other Congressional Democrats insist that they are not cowed by the prospect of a tough Republican response and that Mr. Daschle was treated unfairly. His aides said he would not hesitate to speak out if events warranted.
The change in tone has not been lost on Republican leaders, who showed that they were willing to take off the gloves at the first sign of a break with the president.
''It is hard for me to get into their heads,'' said the House majority leader, Representative Tom {DeLay}, Republican of Texas, who was among those who flayed Mr. Daschle, as he looked at the Democratic strategy today. ''What I have noticed is the rhetoric has toned down considerably, which I greatly appreciate.''
Democratic lawmakers and strategists say it makes sense to stay mum when the war plan is under fire from senior military officers, former commanders and establishment Republicans. Charges from those quarters carry much more weight than partisan carping from Capitol Hill, where some members are willing to concede a lack of military expertise.
''It is clearly not going as some had anticipated,'' Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said. ''Why that is and who is at fault I am not competent to judge.''
The conflict with Iraq has confounded the Democrats politically for months as they have struggled with how to respond to the president and the Republicans on the issue. Their approach for the moment appears to be to stay silent and see how events unfold and to use the debate over domestic security financing as a proxy, accusing the administration of shortchanging safety and forcing local governments to pick up the bill.
Democrats also say the Republican effort to muffle dissent has been scurrilous, a strategy of impugning the patriotism of people who dare speak out against administration policy. Some critics suggest that the party has not been aggressive enough in fighting that idea, limiting Democrats' ability to weigh in.
''Until the leadership of the party is willing to say, 'Don't tell me that I can't be for the troops and against the war,' nothing will change,'' said Representative Jose E. Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx.
Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan was the latest Democrat to find himself on the receiving end of Republican and conservative attacks after suggesting last week on a Fox News program that Iraqi women and children were being bombed in the effort to overthrow President Saddam Hussein.
That touched off a harsh exchange on the program and set the telephones ringing in his Congressional office. On conservative Web sites, Mr. Rangel's remark was portrayed as near treasonous, and he was savaged on the weekend talk shows. But Mr. Rangel, who said he faced no political risk, because his constituents share his views, said he would not be silenced.
''I am not going to stop,'' he said today. ''There is nothing so important to me than the taking of life.''}

	volume = {44},
	abstract = {The U.S. military's prevailing norms of professionalism exhibit three paradoxes that render the organization poorly suited to meet contemporary challenges to its nonpartisan ethic, and that undermine its relations with civilian leaders. These norms, based on Samuel Huntington's objective civilian control model, argue that the military should operate in a sphere separate from the civilian domain of policymaking and decisions about the use of force. The first paradox is that Huntingtonian norms, though intended to prevent partisan and political behavior by military personnel, can also enable these activities. Second, the norms promote civilian leaders’ authority in decisionmaking related to the use of force, yet undermine their practical control and oversight of military activity. Third, they contribute to the military's operational and tactical effectiveness, while corroding the United States’ strategic effectiveness in armed conflict. These tensions in Huntington's norms matter today because of intensifying partisanship in society and in the military, the embrace by civilian leaders of objective control and their concomitant delegation of authority in armed conflict to the military, and growing questions about the causes of the inconclusive outcomes of the United States’ recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is time to develop a new framework for military professionalism.},

A geometric model is developed to represent differences in the ways that individuals rank-order seven important values: freedom, equality, economic security, social order, morality, individualism, and patriotism. The model is fitted to data on value choices from the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. The empirical results show that there is an enormous amount of heterogeneity among individual value choices; the model estimates contradict any notion that there is a consensus on fundamental principles within the mass public. Further, the differences break down along political lines, providing strong evidence that there is a culture war generating fundamental divisions within twenty-first century American society.},

	abstract = {Identity Crisis provides a gripping account of the campaign that appeared to break all the political rules--but in fact didn't. It takes readers from the bruising primaries to an election night whose outcome defied the predictions of the pollsters and pundits. The book shows how fundamental characteristics of the nation and its politics--the state of the economy, the Obama presidency, and the demographics of the political parties--combined with the candidates' personalities and rhetoric to produce one of the most unexpected presidencies in history. Early on, the fundamental characteristics predicted an extremely close election. And even though Trump's many controversies helped Clinton maintain a comfortable lead for most of the campaign, the prediction of a close election became reality when Americans cast their votes. Identity Crisis reveals how Trump's victory was foreshadowed by changes in the Democratic and Republican coalitions that were driven by people's racial and ethnic identities. The campaign then reinforced and exacerbated those cleavages as it focused on issues related to race, immigration, and religion. The result was an epic battle not just for the White House but about what America is and should be},

This study assesses trends in how partisanship and ideology affect confidence in the military. Multivariate analysis of General Social Survey and Harris Poll data shows that while confidence has increased for all demographic and political subgroups, partisanship and ideology play larger roles than commonly recognized. Democrats and Republicans are more confident than independents, but Republican confidence increased sharply over the last 20 years. Party {ID} is now the best predictor of one's confidence in the military. Conservative ideology has little effect, but liberalism reduces confidence, splitting Democrats. The pattern is not only ?Republicanization,? however; partisans on both sides are more confident when their party holds the White House.},

	abstract = {As with the post-Cold War downsizing during the Clinton administration in the late 1990s, one critical challenge for the U.S. Army centers on the qualitative, institutional character of the Army after the reductions -- will the U.S. Army manifest the essential characteristics and behavior of a military profession with soldiers and civilians who see themselves sacrificially called to a vocation of service to country within a motivating professional culture that sustains a meritocratic ethic, or will the Army's character be more like any other government occupation in which its members view themselves as filing a job, motivated mostly by the extrinsic factors of pay, location, and work hours? In mid-2010, the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff directed the Commanding General, Training and Doctrine Command, then General Martin Dempsey, to undertake a broad campaign of learning, involving the entire Department. The intent was to think through what it means for the Army to be a profession of arms and for its soldiers and civilians to be professionals as the Army largely returns stateside after a decade of war and then quickly transitions to the new era of Defense reductions. Several new preceptions of the Army as a military profession have been produced, along with numerous initiatives that are currently being staffed to strengthen the professional character of the Army as it simultaneously recovers from a decade of war and transitions through reductions in force. They form the descriptive content of this monograph},

We find that, despite the reality of market-based recruitment, many Americans continue to subscribe to an idealized image of service members as moved by self-sacrificing patriotism. This belief is most heavily concentrated among conservative Americans. Liberal Americans are more likely to believe that service members join primarily for economic reasons. Those furthest to the left are more inclined to aver that service members join chiefly to escape desperate circumstances. Perhaps most surprising, we discover a disconnect between respondents with military experience and their families: The former are more likely to acknowledge that pay and benefits are a primary motivation for service, whereas their families are more likely to embrace a patriotic service narrative.},

However, to insist that officers should remain apolitical ignores the fact that in the American system policy making and the development of strategy cannot be easily separated from the political process. Yet such a separation is what many scholars suggest. For officers to avoid the world of politics would mean removing them from the debates about policy and strategy that require their input. Military leaders must contribute to the policy process and navigate the shoals of politics while maintaining trust between the civilian and military sides of policy formulation.},

Two weeks after the terrorist attacks, 64 percent of those responding to a Washington Post poll said they trust the government in Washington to do what is right 'just about always' or 'most of the time.' In April 2000, just 30 percent of Americans showed such support. That we trust in the federal government in times of need is no surprise, but at least since the early 1970s, most Americans claimed not to trust the federal government most of the time - until recently.

King and Zachary Karabell show that the rally-around-the-flag effect we have seen since September 11 is part of a longer trend partly driven by a new generation of Americans, largely Generation X (born 1961 through 1975) and especially Millenials (born after 1975). The authors look at why this new generation trusts the government and especially the U.S. military more deeply that their Baby Boomer parents ever have. Relying upon extensive polling data, T},

This conflict is especially problematic because loyalty is often seen, especially by serving military personnel, as the highest of military virtues. The paper introduces a categorisation of ethical issues into two main types, which are referred to as 'ethical dilemmas' and 'tests of integrity' which is then used to clarify the issues involved when duty and loyalty come into conflict. It is argued that a true understanding of loyalty and disloyalty means that the demands of loyalty can never legitimately override a genuine duty to follow orders.},

However, little empirical work has examined how military personnel understand, feel, and enact loyalty. We use a symbolic interactionalist informed frame to explore the lived experience of 24 retired Australian Defence Force members via in-depth semi-structured interviews. Our analysis revealed three core themes: (1) Loyalty as reciprocity, where there was an expectation that loyalty would be returned no matter what. (2) The importance of emotional connection for cohesion. (3) Loyalty as a prioritizing process, where a soldier?s loyalties gave them a way of choosing between competing demands. Loyalty is a moral emotion that enabled sensemaking. Close interpersonal loyalties tended to trump wider/diffused loyalties. Respondents understood their loyalties to fellow soldiers within wider social constructs of mateship and professionalism. The findings show the risks that come from a reliance on loyalty for combat cohesion.},

It argues that members of privileged in-groups in highly exclusive regimes can be trapped into compliance with the regime. Ethnic exclusion helps to construct privileged-group members as regime loyalists. They therefore fear rebel reprisals even if they surrender or defect and consequently persist in fighting. The article finds in particular that, in ethnically exclusive regimes, privileged-group members mistrust even rebels who mobilize on a nonethnic agenda and regard rebel reassurances, including nonethnic aims, as suspect. Exclusion therefore induces privileged-group cohesion, an effect more resistant to rebel reassurances than previously recognized. A case study of the Syrian civil war shows this dynamic at a micro level, and a cross-national statistical analysis gives partial evidence that it lengthens civil conflicts on a larg`e scale.},

Unlike most analyses of countries' military power, which focus on material and basic resources--such as the size of populations, technological and industrial base, and {GNP}--this volume takes a more expansive view. The study's overarching argument is that states' global environments and the particularities of their cultures, social structures, and political institutions often affect how they organize and prepare for war, and ultimately impact their effectiveness in battle. The creation of military power is only partially dependent on states' basic material and human assets. Wealth, technology, and human capital certainly matter for a country's ability to create military power, but equally important are the ways a state uses those resources, and this often depends on the political and social environment in which military activity takes place.},

Many believe that democracy causes these traits. If so, our findings strengthen democratic effectiveness theory by explicating its causal mechanism. But others see democracy as a consequence rather than a cause of such traits. If so, our findings challenge the thesis by identifying alternative causes of the effectiveness bonus previously attributed to democracy. Either way, the results show a powerful effect for unit level variables in military performance. In the process, these same results sharpen our understanding of military effectiveness in general, and the relationship between military performance and regime type in particular.},

It suggests that, in small-coalition systems, the probability of coup attempts and successes decreases as coalition size decreases. We develop an alternative theory of political accountability that focuses on a coalition?s capacity to coordinate sanctions against a leader. It generates a rival expectation?in small-coalition systems, the probability of coup attempts and successes increases as coalition size decreases. We evaluate these hypotheses through quantitative tests on coup attempts and successes during 1950 to 1999 and with an illustrative case study of the Saint-Sylvestre Coup in the Central African Republic. These analyses provide strong support for our theory of political accountability.},

Protests also ease coordination obstacles among coup plotters and make international actors less likely to punish coup leaders. We expect these signaling processes to be strongest when protests take place near the capital or are nonviolent. Our empirical analyses introduce event-level protest data from the Social, Political, and Economic Event Database project into the coup literature. Examining a global sample of coup attempts from 1951 to 2005, we find strong support for our theoretical expectations. Our discussion provides implications for scholars studying coups and nonviolent movements more generally. It also speaks to the influence of external actors on social uprisings and highlights the importance of geographical disaggregation in the study of dissident behavior.},

We argue that existing accounts of civil-military relations are ill equipped to explain the diverse patterns in exit, resistance, and loyalty during unrest because they often ignore the effects of military hierarchy. Disaggregating the military and parsing the interests and constraints of different agents in that apparatus is crucial for explaining military cohesion during such crises. Drawing on extensive fieldwork we apply our principal-agent framework to explain varying degrees and types of military cohesion in three Arab Spring cases: Bahrain, Yemen, and Syria. Studying military hierarchy elucidates decision-making within authoritarian regimes amid mass mobilization and allows us to better explain regime re-stabilization, civil war onset, or swift regime change in the wake of domestic unrest.},

	abstract = {Affective polarization describes the phenomenon whereby people identifying as Republican or Democrat tend to view opposing partisans negatively and co-partisans positively. Though extensively studied, there remain important gaps in scholarly understanding of affective polarization. In particular, (a) how it relates to the distinct behavioural phenomena of in-party “love” vs. out-party hostility; and (b) to what extent it reflects a generalized evaluative disparity between partisans vs. a domain-specific disparity in evaluation. We report the results of an investigation that bears on both of these questions. Specifically, drawing on recent trends in political science and psychology, we hypothesize that moral polarization—the tendency to view opposing partisans’ moral character negatively, and co-partisans’ moral character positively—will be associated with behavioural hostility towards the out-party. We test this hypothesis in two preregistered studies comprising behavioural measures and large convenience samples of {US} partisans (combined N = 1354). Our results strike an optimistic chord: Taken together, they suggest that this association is probably small and somewhat tenuous. Though moral polarization itself was large—perhaps exceeding prior estimates of trait affective polarization—even the most morally polarized partisans appeared reluctant to engage in a mild form of out-party hostility. These findings converge with recent evidence that polarization—moral or otherwise—has yet to translate into the average {US} partisan wanting to express hostile and directly discriminatory behaviour toward their out-party counterparts.},

The main line began with Jean Piaget and includes developmental psychologists who have studied the acquisition of moral concepts and reasoning. The alternative line began in the 1990s with a new synthesis of evolutionary, neurological, and social-psychological research in which the central phenomena are moral emotions and intuitions. In this essay, I show how both of these lines have been shaped by an older debate between two 19th century narratives about modernity: one celebrating the liberation of individuals, the other mourning the loss of community and moral authority. I suggest that both lines of moral psychology have limited themselves to the moral domain prescribed by the liberation narrative, and so one future step for moral psychology should be to study alternative moral perspectives, particularly religious and politically conservative ones in which morality is, in part, about protecting groups, institutions, and souls.},

In the present research, we tested whether the persuasiveness of explicitly moral counterattitudinal messages depends on how much people have already based their attitudes on moral considerations. A survey of the literature suggests several competing hypotheses that we tested across two studies. The results support a persuasive-matching pattern: A moral appeal was more persuasive than a nonmoral appeal to the extent that initial attitudes were based on moral concerns (i.e., attitudes were moralized), but the opposite was true when initial attitudes had less of a moral basis. Exploratory analyses also showed that these effects were mediated by valenced thoughts about the message and moderated by political orientation. These findings add new insight to literatures on both the effects of moral arguments and moralized attitudes.},

Instead, we recommend using multiple items to measure attention. We also show that Screener passage correlates with politically relevant characteristics, which limits the generalizability of studies that exclude failers. We conclude that attention is best measured using multiple Screener questions and that studies using Screeners can balance the goals of internal and external validity by presenting results conditional on different levels of attention.},

	abstract = {The political landscape in the {US} and many other countries is characterized by policy impasses and animosity between rival political groups. Research finds that these divisions are fueled in part by disparate moral concerns and convictions that undermine communication and understanding between liberals and conservatives. This “moral empathy gap” is particularly evident in the moral underpinnings of the political arguments members of each side employ when trying to persuade one another. Both liberals and conservatives typically craft arguments based on their own moral convictions rather than the convictions of the people they target for persuasion. As a result, these moral arguments tend to be unpersuasive, even offensive, to their recipients. The technique of moral reframing—whereby a position an individual would not normally support is framed in a way that is consistent with that individual's moral values—can be an effective means for political communication and persuasion. Over the last decade, studies of moral reframing have shown its effectiveness across a wide range of polarized topics, including views of economic inequality, environmental protection, same-sex marriage, and major party candidates for the {US} presidency. In this article, we review the moral reframing literature, examining potential mediators and moderators of the effect, and discuss important questions that remain unanswered about this phenomenon.},

	title = {No Substitute for Experience: Presidents, Advisers, and Information in Group Decision Making},
	volume = {71},
	abstract = {Despite advances in the study of individuals in international relations, we still know little about how the traits and biases of individuals aggregate. Most foreign policy decisions are made in groups, usually by elites with varying degrees of experience, which can have both positive and negative psychological effects. This paper addresses the aggregation problem by exploring how the balance of foreign policy experience among leaders and advisers affects decision making in war, using a principalagent framework that allows the relative experience of leaders and advisers to vary. A leader’s experience affects decision making and, ultimately, the risks associated with conflict, through three mechanisms. First, experience influences a leader’s ability to monitor advisers. Second, a leader’s experience affects the credibility of delegation to experienced advisers and, in turn, the nature and extent of information gathering. Third, experience affects whether leaders are able to diversify advice, as well as their preference for policies that appear certain. I illustrate the argument using two cases that hold an unusual number of factors constant: the 1991 and 2003 Iraq Wars. George W. Bush’s inexperience exacerbated the biases of his advisers, whereas his father’s experience cast a long shadow over many of the same officials. Understanding the experience and biases of any one individual is insufficient—the balance of experience within a group is also important. Experience is therefore not fungible: a seasoned team cannot substitute for an experienced leader.},

Much of the canonical literature on civil-military relations was written at the height of the Cold War, a time of bipolarity with different global threats and distributions of power. This book considers how social media, changing means of warfare, deepening political divisions, the emergence of autocratic regimes, and an increasingly volatile and unpredictable operational environment have affected the organization of what is conventionally assumed to be an apolitical profession. As such, it argues that modern means and methods of warfare, not to mention evolving norms on the use of force, are reshaping the contours of what it means to be "professional" and what healthy civil-military relations look like in practice. The chapters account for new geopolitical realities and the changing character of war, address the question of how the United States can maintain the professionalization of its military in a time of domestic polarization and when the military is called upon to perform tasks beyond the management of violence, and explores civil-military relations in an increasingly dynamic and complex threat environment. In this environment, uses of force no longer involve formal declarations of war or conventional deployments of force, but rather encompass a diverse range of activities from cyberwar, to information operations, to other forms of asymmetric warfare"--},

We develop a model of the public as a democratic check and evaluate it using two empirical strategies: an original, nationally representative candidate-choice experiment in which some politicians take positions that violate key democratic principles, and a natural experiment that occurred during Montana’s 2017 special election for the U.S. House. Our research design allows us to infer Americans’ willingness to trade-off democratic principles for other valid but potentially conflicting considerations such as political ideology, partisan loyalty, and policy preferences. We find the U.S. public’s viability as a democratic check to be strikingly limited: only a small fraction of Americans prioritize democratic principles in their electoral choices, and their tendency to do so is decreasing in several measures of polarization, including the strength of partisanship, policy extremism, and candidate platform divergence. Our findings echo classic arguments about the importance of political moderation and cross-cutting cleavages for democratic stability and highlight the dangers that polarization represents for democracy.},

As partisan affect has intensiﬁed, it is also more structured; ingroup favoritism is increasingly associated with outgroup animus.

	abstract = {"This book looks at current civil-military relations, in which a professionalized military is largely subordinated to civilian control. Much of the canonical literature on civil-military relations was written at the height of the Cold War, a time of bipolarity with different global threats and distributions of power. This book considers how social media, changing means of warfare, deepening political divisions, the emergence of autocratic regimes, and an increasingly volatile and unpredictable operational environment have affected the organization of what is conventionally assumed to be an apolitical profession. As such, it argues that modern means and methods of warfare, not to mention evolving norms on the use of force, are reshaping the contours of what it means to be "professional" and what healthy civil-military relations look like in practice. The chapters account for new geopolitical realities and the changing character of war, address the question of how the United States can maintain the professionalization of its military in a time of domestic polarization and when the military is called upon to perform tasks beyond the management of violence, and explores civil-military relations in an increasingly dynamic and complex threat environment. In this environment, uses of force no longer involve formal declarations of war or conventional deployments of force, but rather encompass a diverse range of activities from cyberwar, to information operations, to other forms of asymmetric warfare"--},

During the Cold War, it proved vital in protecting numerous regimes from communist takeovers. Successful outcomes occurred when American leaders made large initial aid commitments, and the states had the capacity and political willpower to use it effectively. However, Vietnam was an example of how U.S. support lagged, as leaders in Saigon preferred political survival instead of creating regime legitimacy. Following 9/11, American security aid focused on making weak countries develop stronger security forces. Unfortunately, this created Fabergé egg militaries: expensive and easily broken by insurgents. This article suggests long-term strategic commitments need to be made alongside more resources for the American State Department and similar organizations to focus on the politics of state-building. Finally, this article suggests strategies, such as “whole-of-government” approaches, to improve long-term security and political institution building.},

We recommend that the quantitative use-of-force literature in international relations begin to take seriously theories of domestic political institutions, partisanship, and interbranch relations that have been developed within American politics.},

	abstract = {The assumptions that military service helps candidates attract votes--while lacking it harms a candidate's chances--has been an article of faith since the electoral coronation of George Washington in 1789. Perhaps the most compelling fact driving the perception that military service helps win votes is the large number of veterans who have held public office. Some candidates even exaggerate their military service to persuade voters. However, sufficient counter-examples undermine the idea that military veterans enjoy an advantage when seeking political office. In Why Veterans Run, Jeremy Teigenexplains the tendency of parties to elevate those with armed forces experience to run for high office. He describes the veteran candidate phenomenon by examining the related factors and patterns, showing why different eras have more former generals running and why the number of veterans in election cycles varies. With both quantitative and qualitative analysis, Why Veterans Run investigates each postwar era in U.S. electoral history and elaborates why so many veterans run for office. Teigen also reveals how election outcomes with veteran candidates illuminate the relationship between the military and civilian spheres as well as the preferences of the American electorate.},

Why have concepts of military power and force employment remained distinct and varied in Europe, and yet, what facilitates their convergence at the European Union level into the ambiguous notion of crisis management? We argue that an important answer to these questions is endogenous to the military: both role conceptions and organizational frames of military institutions are key underlying aspects of the differences at the national level and of the common ground at the European Union level. We examine and compare empirically the role conceptions and organizational frames of the armed forces in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom since the early 1990s.},

The forces of modernity unleashed by the war had led to astonishing advances in daily life, but technology and mass culture also threatened to erode the country's traditional moral character. As award-winning historian George M. Marsden explains in The Twilight of the American Enlightenment, postwar Americans looked to the country's secular, liberal elites for guidance in this precarious time, but these intellectuals proved unable to articulate a coherent common cause by which America could chart its course. Their failure lost them the faith of their constituents, paving the way for a Christian revival that offered America a firm new moral vision-one rooted in the Protestant values of the founders. A groundbreaking reappraisal of the country's spiritual reawakening, The Twilight of the American Enlightenment shows how America found new purpose at the dawn of the Cold War. "-- "In The Twilight of the American Enlightenment, Bancroft Prize-winning historian George Marsden examines the faltering attempts by the country's brightest minds to establish a new national identity and purpose for postwar America, and explains how their efforts--and eventual failure--helped to shape the society we live in today. As Marsden shows, the nation's challenges heavily influenced political debates and American art during the 1950s. Playwrights and novelists in particular reflected on the simultaneous conformity and alienation of modern man, with authors such as Dwight {MacDonald} and James Baldwin lamenting the new "mass man," whom mass media had robbed of all individualism. So too did sociologists Erich Fromm and David Riesman, whose idea of a "lonely crowd" seemed to sum up the inauthenticity of mainstream America. Political philosophers including Walter Lippmann, meanwhile, feared that the pragmatism of thinkers such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Daniel Bell--who rejected wholesale ideologies in favor of a relativistic, selective politics--had left the nation directionless at a crucial moment in American history"--}

Here, Deneen offers an astringent warning that the centripetal forces now at work on our political culture are not superficial flaws but inherent features of a system whose success is generating its own failure." --},

	abstract = {If public opinion about foreign policy is such an elite-driven process, why does the public often disagree with what elites have to say? We argue here that elite cue-taking models in International Relations are both overly pessimistic and unnecessarily restrictive. Members of the public may lack information about the world around them, but they do not lack principles, and information need not only cascade from the top down. We present the results from five survey experiments where we show that cues from social peers are at least as strong as those from political elites. Our theory and results build on a growing number of findings that individuals are embedded in a social context that combines with their general orientations toward foreign policy in shaping responses toward the world around them. Thus, we suggest the public is perhaps better equipped for espousing judgments in foreign affairs than many of our top-down models claim.},

This paper proposes an overarching framework for thinking about diﬀerences between elites and masses, presenting the results of a meta-analysis of 162 paired treatments from paired experiments on political elites and mass publics, as well as an analysis of 12 waves of historical elite and mass public opinion data on foreign policy issues over a 43 year period. It ﬁnds political scientists both overstate the magnitude of elite-public gaps in decision-making, and misunderstand the determinants of elite-public gaps in political attitudes, many of which are due to basic compositional diﬀerences rather than to elites’ domain-speciﬁc expertise.},

Five thousand subjects were confronted with an embedded fake {TV}-news item in which the five leaders of the main Belgian parties offered their parties’ stance on six issues. We find that issue ownership is a dynamic process and that news exposure leads to significant shifts in issue ownership. Especially on issues that are not owned by any party, a communicative performance by the party leader can make a difference. Regarding preowned issues, the effect is conditional; it depends on the balance of the news item.},

This article provides a fuller test using candidate advertising data from the 1998, 2000, and 2002 House and Senate elections and finds that neither theory is supported. Candidates did not consistently emphasize owned or salient issues in any of these elections. Moreover, candidate agendas have little effect on electoral outcomes.

	abstract = {Civil-military relations theorists have long warned against the participation of armed forces in domestic missions in democratic societies. They argue that such domestic roles bolster the military politically and eventually lead to the overthrow of democratic governments. Yet for two decades now, democratic governments have enlisted the help of their militaries domestically without risk to the regime. Civilian leaders often provide the military with internal roles to compensate for the inability of the state to provide the public and private goods demanded by citizens, particularly in times of internal economic or social crisis. Even in the midst of crisis, democratic governments can withstand military involvement in a range of domestic projects, from food distribution to policing to provision of health services. This article argues that military political intervention that accompanies participation in internal missions is only one possible outcome of moments of severe conflict induced by crisis, and will occur only when weak democracies with low levels of civilian control are victims of such crises. We examine this relationship in a comparison of two Latin American cases: Argentina and Venezuela.},

The two sides of this divide are not separated by their commitment to Christ, or the lack thereof. But make no mistake about it: this divide is real. Not only is it causing the fractures we see in the country at large, but it is manifesting itself in churches, individual families, and around the world. In Fault Lines, Voddie Baucham exposes the root causes of this divide, warning of the devastation it will cause, and preparing the church for the messy cleanup that must follow"--},
