# Notes for Data Cleaning

In this document, I have essentially cleaned 5 x data sets containing information about various presidential campaign television advertisements contained in the 2000 - 2016 Elections. 

As each data set is unique, I have taken care to standardize the data sets and prepare them in such a way so as to facilitate future coding. In the paragraphs to follow, I first outline the procedures taken before embarking on these coding procedures and tasks.  

The first cleaning of data began in March of 2021.  At this time, I was only interested in analyzing the individual advertisements; that is, I simply wanted to count the distinct number of advertisements made and aired in each election cycle, and analyze these specific advertisements at the ad level.  This analysis occurred mainly from March of 2021 - December 2021. 

In February of 2022, however, I was directed by my dissertation committee to embark on an additional analysis of the airings of the advertisements. This is different from the first analysis because in analyzing the "airings" rather than the "ads," the goal instead was to examine which ads were aired on which markets, at what frequency, etc. This document is the document that I used to clean and organize the data.  It is a substantial and lengthy document, and quite detailed.  

This document proceeds in three main parts.  The first part is the culmination of cleaning work to produce a consolidated data set of the individual advertisements. The second part is the cleaning of an airings level analysis which is then merged with the first data set after edits had been made on the advertisement level. In both parts, I take many notes in the hopes that I would be able to follow these procedures myself, later down the road, or if other ever wanted to build upon this work here.    

## The Data 

Data from the 2016 and 2012 data sets came from the Wesleyan Media Project (WMP), whereas the data from the 2008, 2004, and 2000 data sets came from the Wisconsin Advertising Project (WiscAd). Each data set is structured somewhat differently. One can detect a fairly straightforward improvement each subsequent election, i.e. the 2000 data is the "roughest," and the data improves each year.  

## Results as of 20 February 2022

In this paragraph, I briefly highlight some notable points about the data. 

## Important Files and Filenames

# Section 1: Forming an Ad-Level Data Set

In this section, I clean 5 x separate data sets, beginning with the 2016 data set and working backwards to the 2000 data set.
